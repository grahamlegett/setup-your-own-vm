# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM
VMware Fusion Ubuntu
The intial OS running on the VM was Linux
Was able to download Virtual Box and setup the VM for Ubuntu but was not able to get Ubuntu installed on VM machine. Tried to change the amout of RAM the VM uses, checked the boot sequence and made sure that it was booting from the ISO file downloaded earlier in the lab, as well as delete and reinstall Virtual Box and VM. After doing some research and working with Dan and Jan,we came to find out that Virtual Box no longer works with Apple Computers which i have. Was able to download VMware Fusion and create the virtual machine. Ubuntu is installed and up and runnning. 
Allocated 4GB of RAM to the machine and 25GB on the hard drive per the lab instructions.  Too much RAM could cause the VM to perform faster but could also slow down my physical computer as well. One could also add as much memory to the hard drive that your physical computer can allow. 

Was not able to complet the last part of the lab due to not having the proper instructions. The directions to add the Guest Additions to Ubuntu and make the settings changes was not possible.
