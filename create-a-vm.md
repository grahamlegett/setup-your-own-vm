# **Create a VM lab••

## ***Your first VM***
### **VMware Fusion Ubuntu**
+ The intial OS running on the VM was Linux
+ Was able to download Virtual Box and setup the VM for Ubuntu but was not able to get Ubuntu installed on VM machine. Tried to change the amout of RAM the VM uses, checked the boot sequence and made sure that it was booting from the ISO file downloaded earlier in the lab, as well as delete and reinstall Virtual Box and VM. After doing some research and working with Dan and Jan,we came to find out that Virtual Box no longer works with Apple Computers which i have. Was able to download VMware Fusion and create the virtual machine.
+ Ubuntu is installed and up and runnning. 
+ Allocated 4GB of RAM to the machine and 25GB on the hard drive per the lab instructions.  Too much RAM could cause the VM to perform faster but could also slow down my physical computer as well. One could also add as much memory to the hard drive that your physical computer can allow. 

+ Was not able to complete the last part of the lab due to not having the proper instructions. The directions to add the Guest Additions to Ubuntu and make the settings changes was not possible. 
## ***Your second VM***
### + Was not able to install second VM so no OS was installed onto it.
+ When trying to create my second VM I tried to replicate the steps that i had to take for the first VM I created with Ubuntu. 
+ I used VMWare as opposed to VirtualBox and was able to setup the VM but when trying to install the desired OS of CentOS I was unsuccessful. 
+ I tried allocating more RAM to the machine as well as increasing the hard disk size.  I increased the RAM up to 8GB and the digital hard drive was set as high as 270GB but yet when checking the hard disk space of the machine after these adjustments there was still only a total of 34GB of total space.  
+ I did some troubleshooting with Jan as well as researched fixes online. 
+ In the end I'm finding it a little tricky at times to do things being is that I have a Mac and M1 chip version as well.  There have been workarounds which has not kept me behind but at the time there have been set backs with no resolution in the end as well.
